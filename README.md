# tensorflow-learning-part-two
I covered neural networks for classification, focusing on architecture, input/output shape checks, and model optimization. I discussed linearity vs. non-linearity, demonstrated parameter tuning for better results, and explained using callbacks to find the optimal learning rate. Lastly I emphasized the importance of visualization in evaluating model
